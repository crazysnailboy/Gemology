# Gemology

A mod for minecraft which adds several new gems based on real life gemstones, each with their respective sets of tools, weapons and armour.


## Credits

This mod was originally a fork of [GemsCraft 2.9](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1282444-1-5-2-discontinued-smp-gemscraft-2-9-more-gems) for Minecraft 1.5.2 written by domi1819, which I updated for Minecraft 1.8. The source code for the original mod can be found [here](https://github.com/domi1819/GemsCraft).

I have expanded the number of different gems included using ideas and/or textures from the following obsolete mods:

[Trekkie Cub's Shiny Things Mod](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1289182-1-5-2-trekkie-cubs-shiny-things-mod) for Minecraft 1.5.2 by dvatreknerd314<br />
[Minerals mod](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/71932-minerals-mod) for Minecraft 1.6.4 by n0b0dy2052
